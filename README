Caterwaul File DB: A really simple flat-file database.
MIT license

Requirements.
The only two requirements are node.js and Caterwaul. Caterwaul comes with this
repository, so all you really need to install is node.js if you don't already
have it (available at github.com/ry/node).

Usage.
First, ** this is not production code! ** -- it can (probably will) lose data,
so you shouldn't use it for important stuff. That said, at some point it will
be production quality, and I'd appreciate bug reports/feedback.

The simplest way to use it is to open a REPL, like this:
$ ./build repl
caterwaul.db.file> var r = db('foo')
caterwaul.db.file> r
{ id: 'foo' }
caterwaul.db.file> r(console.log)       // Get value
{}
caterwaul.db.file> r({bar: 'bif'})      // Update value
{ id: 'foo' }
caterwaul.db.file> r(console.log)
{ bar: 'bif' }
caterwaul.db.file>

Full API documentation is available in the source code, viewable as HTML in
sdoc.html.
